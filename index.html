<h1>MODERN WEBSITES ARE EVIL!</h1>
Modern websites are the worst thing ever.<br>
Since the release of HTML 5, websites are including SO MUCH SHIT that it makes the sites slower on lower end hardware.<br><br>
OK, I may be exaggerating, because these days we have these smartphones, which are basically computers in your pocket, and if you didn't get your smartphone from Turkish homosex seller for 5 Lira, its processor is not a chump either. <i>Try saying that about old PCs from the 90s, bitches can't even talk to my WPA2 wifi.</i><br><br>
My message to web designers is keep your websites simple and most importantly <b>STOP FILLING THAT SHIT WITH SO MANY ADS.</b><br>
